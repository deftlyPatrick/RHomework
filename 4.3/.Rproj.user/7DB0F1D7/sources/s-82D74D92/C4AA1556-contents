## Introduction to R Markdown (taken from the R Markdown template)

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

We use it in this class so that you can write up your R code, your math work, and your written homework all in one document. You must use this for your R code. If you prefer to write down math equations by hand, you may do so as well, but attach all work to your R Markdown document whenever a homework problem requires R or a written explanation.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


## Question 1
\textbf{a) Label questions} Label each question so I know which question you're working on. 

\textbf{b) Label parts of the question} Also label the parts of the question like this.




## Question 2: Math equations
You can also include math equations by surrounding them in **two dollar signs**. The following example is taken from the R Markdown template.

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x} = ln(x)
$$

## Question 3: R code
You can include pieces of R code by surrounding them in **triple quotes** and after the begining triple quotes, you need to **put a label**.  The following two pieces of R code are taken from the R Markdown template.

\textbf{a)  R code snippit and output} Here is an example of R code and output.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```


\textbf{b) Include plots}

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```
